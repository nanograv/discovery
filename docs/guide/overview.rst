What is Discovery?
------------------

*Discovery* is a next-generation pulsar-timing-array data-analysis package, **built for speed** on a `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ backend that supports GPU execution and autodifferentiation.

Philosophy
----------

If `Enterprise <https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise>`_ is Spock—logical and elegant—*Discovery* is all Scotty: fast, efficient, and not above a hack if it gets you to warp speed.
